Need to get the flow of adding a new machine to my git
Find a workflow to follow that i can easily replicate on new devices if i need to quickly have access to files or if i have local files i need to save to a repo

Step 1. git clone {git url}
  - Create a folder e.g Git101 After cloning a subfolder will be created with name of repo

Step 2. git status
- to confirm that you are in synch with main

Step 3. git commit -m 'msg'

Step 4. git push origin main
